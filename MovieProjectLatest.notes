TODO:
- Put DB config in a properties file
- Fix tests and add more test coverage
- Look at possibly seperating endpoints in controller (FilmController)
- Implement additional funcationality:
      * Searching for films by Actor/Director
      * Searching for entities by value other than ID/Ref (i.e name, rating[film])
